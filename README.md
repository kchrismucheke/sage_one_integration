# SageOne Integration

A fun little project that helps you load CSV files directly from your FTP server and map them to the SageOne API.

To test this out copy the `.env.example` and create a new file named `.env`. Inside the `.env` file you will need to fill out all your FTP login credentials as well as adding your SageOne API key

*Some few bugs to iron out*
